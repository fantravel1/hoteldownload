          <h2 id="intro-title">Do Hotels Really Track Your Searches and Raise Prices?</h2>
          <p>You've probably heard the claim: "Hotels and booking sites track your searches and raise prices the more you look." It's one of the most persistent travel myths online. But is it actually true?</p>

          <p><strong>The short answer: It's complicated.</strong> While major booking platforms officially deny using cookies to inflate prices for returning visitors, independent research and testing have documented real price variations that can't be easily explained.</p>

            <div class="callout__title">The Key Finding</div>
            <div class="callout__text">Independent testing across 50+ markets found price variations of 5-15% based on device type, browsing history, and apparent location. Whether this is deliberate "price discrimination" or just algorithmic personalization remains debated.</div>

        </div>

        <div class="prose">
          <h3>What the Research Shows</h3>
          <p>Several academic and journalistic investigations have explored this question:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Northeastern University (2014):</strong> Found that Priceline and Cheaptickets showed higher prices to users on mobile devices, while Home Depot steered Mac users toward pricier products.</li>
            <li><strong>Consumer Reports (2019):</strong> Documented price differences of up to 8% when searching the same hotel from different browsers and devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Wall Street Journal (2012):</strong> Revealed that Staples showed different prices based on the user's proximity to competitor stores.</li>
            <li><strong>ProPublica (2016):</strong> Found that Amazon showed Prime members higher prices on certain products.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While these studies don't prove that every hotel search is being manipulated, they demonstrate that personalized pricing based on user data is a real practice across e-commerce.</p>

          <h3>Why Mobile Prices Are Often Lower</h3>
          <p>Booking platforms aggressively promote their mobile apps because:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Push notifications:</strong> Apps can send you alerts about price drops, flash sales, and abandoned searches.</li>
            <li><strong>Lock-in effect:</strong> Once you have the app, you're more likely to book through it than compare competitors.</li>
            <li><strong>Better conversion data:</strong> Apps provide more accurate tracking and attribution than mobile web.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced comparison shopping:</strong> Switching between apps is more effort than opening browser tabs.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Platforms Known for Mobile Discounts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Booking.com:</strong> "Mobile-only rates" prominently displayed, often 10-15% off.</li>
            <li><strong>Expedia:</strong> "App deals" section with exclusive prices, plus mobile-only coupons.</li>
            <li><strong>Hotels.com:</strong> "Secret Prices" available only in the app for logged-in users.</li>
            <li><strong>Agoda:</strong> Insider Deals and mobile-exclusive discounts, especially in Asia.</li>
            <li><strong>Hopper:</strong> Mobile-only platform with price prediction and freeze features.</li>

              <p>While major booking platforms deny this practice, independent testing has found price variations of 5-15% based on browsing patterns and device type. The safest approach is to compare prices in incognito mode and across multiple devices. Even if it's not deliberate price manipulation, using privacy measures costs nothing and occasionally reveals better deals.</p>

              <p>Incognito mode prevents cookies from tracking your searches, which may help avoid price increases on repeated searches. However, it doesn't hide your IP address or prevent browser fingerprinting. For best results, combine incognito mode with clearing cookies and comparing prices on different devices.</p>

              <p>Search for the same hotel in regular mode, note the price. Clear cookies or open incognito mode, search again. Compare on a different device or browser. If prices differ significantly (more than $5-10), the site may be using dynamic pricing based on your profile. Run tests within a few minutes to avoid false positives from demand-based price changes.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Dynamic pricing is when hotels adjust prices in real-time based on demand, occupancy, day of week, season, and competitor prices. This is normal and accepted practice. What's controversial is price discrimination based on individual user data, like showing higher prices to users who appear more willing to pay.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Major platforms like Booking.com, Expedia, and Hotels.com officially deny raising prices for repeat searchers. However, they do confirm using cookies for personalization, recommendations, and targeted ads. The distinction between "personalization" and "price discrimination" can be blurry.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>In most countries, dynamic pricing is legal as long as it doesn't discriminate based on protected characteristics (race, gender, age, etc.). Price variations based on device, location, or browsing history exist in a legal gray area. The EU has stronger consumer protection rules requiring price transparency.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>A VPN can help test location-based pricing differences, but adds complexity. Some booking sites block VPN traffic or show errors. VPNs can also slow your connection. Start with incognito mode and device switching before trying VPNs. If you do use a VPN, try servers in different countries to compare prices.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>For best results, clear cookies before each new hotel search session, or use incognito/private browsing mode consistently. Browser extensions like Cookie AutoDelete can automate this process by removing cookies when you close a tab, giving you a fresh start each time.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, but usually lower prices! Loyalty members often get exclusive discounts like Genius rates on Booking.com or member pricing on Expedia. Being logged into a loyalty account typically helps rather than hurts your pricing, as platforms want to reward and retain members. Compare logged-in vs. logged-out prices to be sure.</p>
