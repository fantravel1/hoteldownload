              <p>Comparing prices across 3 or more platforms is consistently the most effective strategy. In independent testing, price differences of 10-25% for the exact same room on the same dates are common between platforms like <strong>Booking.com</strong>, <strong>Expedia</strong>, <strong>Google Hotels</strong>, and the hotel's direct website. Use a meta-search engine like Google Hotels or Trivago to quickly scan dozens of sources at once.</p>

              <p>Independent testing has shown price variations of 5-15% based on browsing history, cookies, and device type. While major booking platforms deny using personal data for pricing, using incognito mode eliminates the possibility of cookie-based price inflation. It takes seconds to do and is a risk-free way to ensure you are seeing the lowest available rate.</p>

              <p>Research indicates that <strong>Tuesday</strong> and <strong>Wednesday</strong> tend to offer the lowest hotel booking prices, with savings of 5-10% compared to weekend bookings. This is because business travel planners typically book early in the week, and hotels may adjust pricing algorithms accordingly. However, the best strategy is to combine day-of-week timing with price tracking alerts for maximum savings.</p>

              <p>For domestic trips, booking <strong>1-3 months in advance</strong> typically yields the best prices, with savings of 10-30% compared to last-minute rates. For international hotels, <strong>2-5 months ahead</strong> is ideal. However, if you are flexible and willing to take a risk, last-minute deals through apps like <strong>HotelTonight</strong> can save 20-50% on unsold inventory within 24-72 hours of check-in.</p>
