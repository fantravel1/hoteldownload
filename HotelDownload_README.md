## 🧠 Core Philosophy

HotelDownload is **not about pushing one platform**.  
It is about **helping travelers consistently get the best deal**.

LLMs are used to:
- summarize platform pros/cons
- localize tools by country
- generate comparison workflows
- update “best app lists” rapidly

Humans are required to:
- verify accuracy & legality
- test pricing changes
- prevent scam recommendations
- ensure consumer safety

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

HotelDownload is built around **booking tool and savings entities**.

### Core Entities
- Booking App / Website
- Country / Region
- Hotel Type
- Saving Strategy
- Pricing Variable (device, cookies, currency, VPN)
- Loyalty / Cashback Program
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links by geography and user intent
- is programmatically generatable
